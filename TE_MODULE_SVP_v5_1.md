# TE MODULE: SVP (Source Verification Protocol)
## TE VERSION 5.1

**Version**: 5.1
**Date**: March 2026
**Type**: Prerequisite gate module (required before VERT, LENS, PPRO)
**Changelog v5.1**: Integration with Confidence Preservation Protocol; extended applicability to political/corporate/contemporary figures; Mobilization Exchange category added; Overall Source Quality field in output format; minor refinements from validation session.

---

## PURPOSE

Before any tradition, teaching, figure, or system can be structurally analyzed (via LENS, VERT, PPRO, OBSERVER), the **provenance and functional validity** of the data itself must be verified. SVP is the prerequisite gate: it determines **what we actually know**, **who said it**, and **whether the technology described was ever actually applied and tested**.

SVP prevents the most common corruption in human knowledge: **treating secondary attribution as primary evidence** — i.e., accepting that "A said X" because B claims A said X.

**Universal Applicability**: SVP applies to any figure or system subject to TE analysis — public, historical, or mythological. This includes without limitation: religious and spiritual figures, philosophers, political leaders, scientists, artists, entertainers, military figures, corporate leaders, institutional founders, and legendary/mythic figures whose historical existence may itself be unverified. The source chain and functional verification requirements are invariant across all domains. The domain determines the available source material, not the analytical method.

## AXIS 1: SOURCE CHAIN INTEGRITY

### Classification Levels

Every claim attributed to a subject must be tagged by its provenance level:

| Level | Code | Definition | Corruption Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Direct** | S₀ | Written, signed, or materially produced by the source. The source's own hand, voice, or documented output. | Lowest (self-editing only) |
| **Witness** | S₁ | Firsthand reconstruction by someone who was present. The witness claims to report what they saw or heard directly. | Medium (filtered by the witness's cognition, memory, bias, and agenda) |
| **Interpreter** | S₂ | Student-of-student, biographer, or analyst working from S₁ material. Did not witness directly. | High (double filter + interpretive framework imposed) |
| **Derivative** | S₃+ | Popular repackaging, summary, commentary-on-commentary, or cultural absorption. No direct chain to source. | Extreme (telephone game — original signal may be unrecognizable) |
| **Void** | S∅ | No verifiable source exists. The attribution is traditional, mythic, or assumed. | Total (we do not know if the source existed, or if they said what is attributed to them) |

### Source Credibility Assessment

Provenance level alone is not sufficient. An S₁ source (firsthand witness) whose **personal conduct reveals demonstrated pathology** structurally contaminates every claim, selection, and attribution they produced — even if they were genuinely present.

For every S₀ and S₁ source, the analyst must ask:

- **Is there documented evidence of pathological behavior** (predation, fraud, abuse of authority) in the source/transmitter?
- **If so, does the pathology structurally connect to the claims being made?** A source's personal failings are relevant only when they create a plausible mechanism of contamination between the pathology and the testimony.

If both conditions are met, the source must be flagged as **S₁ᶜ (Compromised)** or **S₀ᶜ (Compromised)** — the provenance level is retained, but a contamination marker is applied.**Critical addition (v5.1)**: The credibility assessment must be **symmetric**. Sources hostile to the subject (ex-allies turned enemies, political opponents, disgruntled former associates) carry bias of hostility just as allied sources carry bias of loyalty. Both must be flagged when the bias creates a plausible mechanism of contamination:

| Source Bias | Flag | Contamination Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Pathological** (predation, fraud, grooming) | S₁ᶜ | Pathology drives selection, attribution, or interpretation |
| **Hostile** (ex-ally, political opponent, competitor) | S₁ʰ | Resentment, revenge, or self-justification distorts testimony |
| **Loyal** (family, current ally, beneficiary) | S₁ˡ | Loyalty, dependency, or benefit distorts testimony |
| **Agenda-driven** (activist, lobbyist, operative) | S₁ᵃ | External agenda selects and frames what is reported |

None of these flags invalidate the source — they mark it for triangulation. A claim supported by converging S₁ʰ (hostile) and S₁ˡ (loyal) sources gains credibility precisely because the biases point in opposite directions.

**Canonical Example (spiritual domain)**: C.W. Leadbeater (Theosophical Society) was a documented pedophile who selected boys — including Jiddu Krishnamurti — using a grooming pattern cloaked in spiritual vocabulary ("your aura is extraordinary, you are the chosen one"). His claimed "astral instruction" of boys during the night was structurally indistinguishable from abuse masked by esoteric terminology. Leadbeater's S₁ claims about Krishnamurti's spiritual status are therefore S₁ᶜ: firsthand, but produced by a predator whose selection mechanism was driven by pathology, not perception. This does not automatically invalidate Krishnamurti's later autonomous work — but it structurally contaminates the *origin story* and every claim Leadbeater made about him.

**Canonical Example (political domain)**: Michael Cohen (former Trump attorney) provides S₁ testimony on Trump's conduct. Cohen is S₁ʰ: a former loyal associate who turned hostile after prosecution. His testimony is firsthand and potentially valuable, but filtered through resentment and self-interest (book deals, media appearances, reduced sentencing). Similarly, family members providing favorable accounts are S₁ˡ. Neither is automatically invalid; both require triangulation with independent sources.

### Provenance Gap

Measure the **temporal and documentary distance** between the source and the earliest available record:

| Gap | Classification |
|---|---|
| **0 years** (source's own extant text) | **Closed** — S₀ available |
| **< 1 generation** (~30 years) | **Narrow** — S₁ plausible, memory still active |
| **1–3 generations** (30–100 years) | **Wide** — Oral transmission, institutional editing likely |
| **> 3 generations** (100+ years) | **Broken** — The chain is structurally severed. What arrives is a tradition, not a testimony |

### Application Examples| Subject | S₀ Material | Provenance Gap | Structural Consequence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Gurdjieff** | *Beelzebub's Tales*, *Meetings with Remarkable Men*, *Life is Real* | Closed (his own texts) | His cosmology has S₀. His "oral teaching" as recorded by Ouspensky is S₁. |
| **Gustavo Rol** | Personal diary (fragments), letters | Closed (for diary). Narrow (for witnesses like Fellini, Buzzati). | Diary quotes are S₀. Witness accounts of phenomena are S₁. CICAP analysis is S₂. |
| **Buddha** | None | Broken (~400 years to first Pali texts) | Everything attributed to "the Buddha" is S∅ at the source and S₃+ at the document level. |
| **Jesus** | None | Wide (~40-70 years to earliest Gospel) | Everything attributed to Jesus is S₁ at best (if Gospel authors witnessed), more likely S₂. |
| **Socrates** | None | Narrow (~20 years to Plato's dialogues) | "Socrates" is structurally a Platonic character. S₁, but filtered through Plato's philosophy. |
| **Donald Trump** | Books (ghostwritten), tweets (archived), speeches, legal depositions, court documents | Closed (abundant S₀) | S₀ abundant but self-curated. S₁ polarized (ex-allies S₁ʰ, family S₁ˡ). S₂+ extreme volume, low signal. |
| **Any living public figure** | Public statements, documented actions, legal/financial filings, recorded appearances | Typically Closed | S₀ available but curated. S₁ sources require bias-flagging. Media coverage is S₂ minimum. |
| **Mythological figure** | None by definition | Broken or S∅ | The figure may not have existed. All analysis operates on the tradition, not on a person. |

## RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOURCE LEVELS AND ANALYTICAL CONFIDENCE

**Note (v5.1)**: The SVP source classification (S₀–S₃/S∅) describes the **provenance of data**. The Confidence Preservation Protocol in the TE Bootloader uses the same notation (S₀–S₃) to describe the **confidence of analytical conclusions**.

These are isomorphic but not identical:

| Concept | SVP Source Level | Analytical Confidence Level |
|---|---|---|
| What it measures | Where the data comes from | How certain the conclusion is |
| S₀ | Source's own documented output | Verified fact |
| S₁ | Firsthand witness account | Triangulable inference |
| S₂ | Interpreter/analyst reconstruction | Structural interpretation |
| S₃ | Derivative/commentary | Working hypothesis |

**The relationship**: Analytical confidence is bounded by source quality but not identical to it. An S₀ source (Trump's own tweet) can support an S₀ analytical claim ("Trump tweeted X on date Y") but also an S₂ analytical interpretation ("Trump's tweet reveals strategy Z"). The data is S₀; the interpretation is S₂. The analyst must tag both.

**Rule**: When building analytical conclusions, the confidence grade must reflect both the source quality AND the inferential distance. High-quality sources (S₀) do not automatically produce high-confidence conclusions — they produce high-confidence *data* from which conclusions of varying confidence can be drawn.

---

## AXIS 2: FUNCTIONAL VERIFICATION

Once the source chain is established, the **technology** (teaching, method, practice, strategy, policy, doctrine) must be tested for functional output — independently of reputation or belief.

### Test Sequence

**F1. Specification**: Is the technology described with sufficient precision to be *applied*?
- If yes → proceed to F2.
- If no → the technology is **structurally unfalsifiable**. It cannot be tested because it was never specified. Flag as: **UNSPECIFIED**.

**F2. Application**: Did anyone actually apply the technology *as prescribed*?
- If yes → proceed to F3.
- If no → the technology is **untested**. All claims about its efficacy are structural projections. Flag as: **UNAPPLIED**.
- If uncertain → flag as: **APPLICATION UNVERIFIABLE**.**F3. Prerequisites Compliance**: Did the technology specify prerequisites for application? If so, were they met? This step is critical because **prerequisite non-compliance does not simply produce "no result" — it produces predictable categories of failure that are themselves diagnostic.**

**F3a. Prerequisite Identification**: Does the source (S₀) define prerequisites, preconditions, or a required sequence of preparation?
- If yes → proceed to F3b.
- If no prerequisites were specified → proceed to F4.
- If prerequisites exist only in S₁+ material (i.e., attributed to the source by others but not in the source's own text) → flag as: **PREREQUISITES UNVERIFIED AT SOURCE**.

**F3b. Prerequisite Compliance**: Were the prerequisites actually met by those who applied the technology?
- If met → proceed to F4.
- If NOT met → the result must be classified under **F3c Failure Categories** below.
- **CAUTION**: If prerequisites are *so extreme* that no human can realistically meet them, they function as a **structural firewall against falsification**. Flag as: **UNFALSIFIABLE PREREQUISITES**.

**F3c. Failure Categories from Prerequisite Non-Compliance**:

When a technology with defined prerequisites is applied without meeting them, the outcome is not random — it falls into predictable structural categories:

| Failure Category | Description | Structural Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Inert / Temporary** | The practice produces superficial, non-lasting effects that are mistaken for results. | Yoga āsana practiced without yama/niyama compliance (as specified in Patañjali's *Yoga Sūtra*) produces stretching and temporary relaxation — physical effects indistinguishable from gymnastics, which practitioners exchange for "spiritual results." |
| **Psychotropic** | The practice produces altered states (emotional highs, visions, catharsis, euphoria) that are mistaken for spiritual or developmental progress but leave no structural change. | Meditation techniques applied without the ethical/behavioral foundation produce "experiences" and "states" — which feel significant but dissipate, creating dependency on the practice-as-drug rather than growth. |
| **Pathological** | The practice actively damages the practitioner because the prerequisite was a **structural safeguard**, not an arbitrary rule. | Surgery performed by an uncertified operator does not produce "no result" — it produces injury or death. The certification is not bureaucracy; it is a prerequisite that protects the patient. |
| **Mobilization Exchange** (v5.1) | The practice produces energy, belonging, adrenaline, and sense of purpose that are mistaken for real change. Participants feel empowered but their actual capacity for autonomous action, critical thinking, or structural change is not increased — and may be decreased. | Political movements where participation (rallies, posting, wearing symbols) is exchanged for genuine civic agency. The participant feels active but produces no structural change — energy is absorbed by the system, not converted into autonomous capacity. Applicable also to corporate "transformation" programs, activist movements, and any system where mobilization-as-activity substitutes for mobilization-as-change. |

**F3d. The Prerequisite Corruption**: When a technology is transmitted without its prerequisites — the technique travels, but the preconditions are stripped during transmission (S₁ → S₂ → S₃+). The result is a practice severed from its safeguards. This is one of the most common and structurally destructive corruption patterns.**F3e. The Structural Fairness Caveat**: When prerequisite non-compliance is invoked to explain failure, the analyst must verify that the prerequisites were:
1. Specified at S₀ level (not invented after the fact to explain away failure)
2. Realistically achievable (not a structural firewall against falsification)
3. Causally connected to the claimed outcome (not arbitrary)

If any of these conditions fails, the "prerequisite defense" is itself a corruption.

**F4. Results Assessment**: What actually happened to those who applied the technology (with or without prerequisites)?

- **Structural Change**: Documented, verifiable, lasting transformation in the practitioner's capacity, behavior, understanding, or condition. Independently observable — not dependent solely on the practitioner's self-report.
- **Subjective Report Only**: The practitioner claims transformation, but no independent verification is available. The claim may be genuine but is structurally opaque.
- **Psychotropic Exchange**: The practitioner reports experiences (states, visions, emotional peaks, catharsis) that are mistaken for the claimed result but produce no lasting structural change. The experience becomes the product, and the practitioner returns for more — creating dependency.
- **Mobilization Exchange** (v5.1): The participant reports empowerment, belonging, purpose, and energy but demonstrates no increase in autonomous capacity, critical thinking, or structural agency. Activity is exchanged for action. Applicable to political, corporate, spiritual, and activist domains.
- **Unfalsifiable Claimed Result**: The practitioner claims a result that **structurally cannot be verified or falsified** by any available means. No test exists, has existed, or could exist to confirm or deny the claim. Examples: "I will not reincarnate again" (Vajrayāna claim after mantra repetition); "I traveled in my astral body" (out-of-body experience literature); "I have achieved enlightenment" (when enlightenment is defined in terms that admit no external verification). **NOTE**: An unfalsifiable claimed result is not necessarily false — it is *structurally opaque*. The protocol cannot confirm it, cannot deny it, and must flag it as such.
- **False Claim / Pretender**: Evidence suggests the practitioner did not achieve the claimed result, or the claim is structurally indistinguishable from self-deception, confabulation, or deliberate fraud. This category applies when the claimed result *could* be verified but evidence contradicts the claim, or when the claimant's behavior is structurally inconsistent with the claimed attainment.
- **No Change**: Practitioner applied method, met prerequisites, no detectable result.
- **Negative Change**: Practitioner was damaged, diminished, or destabilized.

### Structural Fairness Principle

> **A technology must not be penalized for the failures of its practitioners.**
>
> If the technology specifies prerequisites (F3a) and the practitioner did not meet them (F3b), or if the practitioner did not apply the method as prescribed (F2), the resulting failure is **not attributable to the technology**. It is attributable to the misapplication.
>
> Conversely, a technology **must not be credited** for results that cannot be structurally connected to its application (see Corruption Signature #5: The Halo Corruption).
>
> The analyst's task is to isolate the technology from its practitioners and ask: *"When applied correctly, with prerequisites met, by the book — what happened?"* Only this answer constitutes evidence about the technology itself.

### Functional Verdict| Result Pattern | Verdict |
|---|---|
| Structural Change in multiple independent practitioners | **FUNCTIONAL** — the technology works |
| Mixed results (some change, some damage) | **FUNCTIONAL BUT HAZARDOUS** — the technology works but lacks safeguards |
| Subjective reports only, no structural verification | **UNVERIFIED** — may work, but evidence is insufficient |
| Psychotropic effects mistaken for the claimed result | **PSYCHOTROPIC** — the technology produces states, not structural transformation |
| Mobilization effects mistaken for real change | **MOBILIZING** — the technology produces energy and belonging, not structural agency |
| Claimed result is structurally unfalsifiable | **UNFALSIFIABLE** — the technology's efficacy cannot be assessed because its claimed outcome admits no verification |
| False claims or pretenders, evidence contradicts | **COUNTERFEIT** — the claimed results are not supported by structural evidence |
| No change despite correct application | **INERT** — the technology does not produce its claimed effects |
| Negative change in practitioners | **TOXIC** — the technology damages its users |
| Never correctly applied / prerequisites never met | **UNTESTED** — no conclusion possible |

## THE FIGURE-MOVEMENT DISTINCTION

### Principle

A public, historical, or mythological figure and the movement(s) that develop around or after that figure are **distinct analytical objects** with separate source chains, separate functional verifications, and potentially divergent trajectories. SVP must analyze them separately before assessing their interaction.

### Why This Matters

| Phenomenon | Structural Risk |
|---|---|
| The movement retroactively rewrites the figure | S₂-S₃+ material produced by the movement is attributed to the figure as if it were S₀. The "real" figure becomes inaccessible behind the movement's construction. |
| The movement strips the figure's prerequisites | The figure's technology specified conditions; the movement transmits the technique without the conditions (Prerequisite Corruption #6). |
| Multiple movements claim the same figure | Different lineages, schools, or factions produce contradictory interpretations of the same source, each claiming authenticity. The figure becomes a projection screen. |
| The figure is partially mythologized | A historical person with S₀ material is transformed into a symbol whose mythological attributes (S₂-S₃+) overshadow the documented record. |
| The movement outlives the figure | Post-death, no new S₀ can be produced. The movement's S₁-S₂ becomes the only active source, with no correction mechanism from the original. |

### Required Analysis

For any figure with an associated movement (or movements), SVP must establish:

**A. Figure Source Chain** — What did the figure actually say, write, do? (S₀, S₁, with bias flags)

**B. Movement Source Chain** — What does the movement attribute to the figure? At what provenance level? Where does the movement's narrative diverge from the figure's S₀?

**C. Mythologization Assessment** — To what extent has the figure been transformed from historical person to mythological symbol? What is the ratio of documented (S₀) to constructed (S₂+) in the current public perception?

**D. Movement Functional Verification** — Separately from the figure's technology: what does the movement actually produce in its participants? (Apply F1-F4 to the movement independently)

**E. Contamination Direction** — Does the movement contaminate the figure (attributing to the figure what the movement invented), or does the figure contaminate the movement (the figure's limitations are inherited by the movement), or both?

### Application Examples| Figure | S₀ Status | Movement(s) | Mythologization | Contamination Direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Gurdjieff** | Closed (own texts) | Multiple post-death schools (Foundation, Bennett lineage, others) | Medium — "miraculous" narratives (S₁) coexist with documented work | Movement → Figure: schools attribute to Gurdjieff teachings he may not have given. Figure → Movement: Gurdjieff's deliberate obscurity inherited as institutional opacity. |
| **Hamer** | Closed (own texts, publications) | "New Germanic Medicine" movement, alternative health networks | High — Hamer the clinician is obscured by Hamer the "persecuted genius." The technology's assessment is contaminated by the movement's ideology. | Movement → Figure: movement's anti-establishment ideology projected onto Hamer's clinical claims. Requires separation to assess the technology on its own merits. |
| **Tesla** | Closed (patents, notebooks, articles) | "Free energy" movement, "suppressed genius" mythology | Very High — Tesla the engineer has S₀; Tesla the "suppressed discoverer of unlimited energy" is S₃+ construction. | Movement → Figure: conspiracy narratives retroactively rewrite Tesla's actual work. The S₀ (patents, documented inventions) is buried under S₃+ mythology. |
| **Beatles (individual members)** | Closed (recordings, interviews, documented actions) | Multiple cultural movements (counterculture, fan communities, spiritual movements via Harrison/Lennon) | Medium to High depending on member — Lennon particularly mythologized post-assassination. | Movement → Figure: cultural movements attribute to the artists intentions and meanings the artists may not have held. Figure → Movement: artists' personal choices (Harrison's spiritual exploration, Lennon's activism) seed movements that evolve independently. |
| **Buddha** | S∅ (no direct material) | Theravāda, Mahāyāna, Vajrayāna, Zen, secular Buddhism | Total — the historical figure is inaccessible. All "Buddhas" are movement constructions. | No figure → movement direction possible (figure is S∅). Each movement constructs its own "Buddha" from S₃+ material. |
| **Hitler** | Closed (Mein Kampf, speeches, documented orders) | Neo-Nazi movements, historical revisionism, "esoteric Hitlerism" | High — both demonization and mythologization coexist. The documented figure (S₀) is overlaid with both "absolute evil" and "misunderstood leader" constructions (S₂-S₃+). | Bidirectional: movements project onto the figure, and the figure's documented ideology seeds the movements. SVP must separate S₀ (what he wrote and did) from both directions of mythologization. |
| **Giordano Bruno** | Partially closed (own texts survive) | "Martyr of science" narrative, esoteric movements | High — Bruno the complex philosopher-hermeticist is reduced to "scientist burned by the Church" (S₂-S₃+ simplification). | Movement → Figure: Enlightenment and later movements retroactively constructed Bruno as a proto-scientist, stripping the hermetic/magical dimensions documented in S₀. |

### Output Format Addition

When the figure-movement distinction is relevant, add to SVP output:

```markdown
[FIGURE-MOVEMENT ANALYSIS]
- Figure S₀ status: [summary]
- Movement(s) identified: [list]
- Mythologization level: [None / Low / Medium / High / Total]
- Movement source chain: [S₁ / S₂ / S₃+ — for each movement]
- Contamination direction: [Figure→Movement / Movement→Figure / Bidirectional]
- Note: [key divergences between figure's S₀ and movement's narrative]
```

## CORRUPTION SIGNATURES

SVP identifies the following recurring corruption patterns in knowledge transmission:1. **The Telephone Corruption**: S₃+ material treated as S₀. ("The Buddha said..." when no S₀ exists. "Sources say Trump planned..." when no source is identified.)
2. **The Authority Corruption**: S₁ material elevated to S₀ because the witness is prestigious. ("Ouspensky wrote it, so Gurdjieff must have said it." "Bolton wrote it in his book, so it must have happened exactly that way.")
3. **The Quantum Corruption**: Derivative agents (S₃+) adopt terminology from a field (physics, psychology, spirituality, intelligence analysis) without understanding the operational content, producing counterfeit knowledge that *sounds* like the original but carries none of its functional weight.
4. **The Unfalsifiable Fortress**: Prerequisites or conditions for application are set so high that failure is always attributable to the practitioner, never to the technology. ("You didn't meditate *enough*. You didn't believe *enough*. The policy hasn't been given *enough time*.")
5. **The Halo Corruption**: Functional results from a related but different cause are attributed to the technology. (e.g., a practitioner improves due to community support, but credits the meditation technique. A country's economy improves due to global conditions, but credits the leader's policy.)
6. **The Prerequisite Corruption**: A technology is transmitted without its prerequisites — the technique travels, but the preconditions are stripped during transmission (S₁ → S₂ → S₃+). The result is a practice severed from its safeguards: yoga without yama/niyama, meditation without ethical grounding, esoteric exercises without preparatory work, constitutional powers without the checks that were designed to accompany them. (See F3d.)
7. **The Predatory Source (Trojan Corruption)**: A source or transmitter with demonstrated pathological conduct (predation, grooming, fraud) uses spiritual, pedagogical, or institutional authority as a *vehicle* for the pathology. The "teaching" or "discovery" functions as a cover mechanism. All claims, selections, and attributions from this source are structurally contaminated (flagged S₀ᶜ or S₁ᶜ). The pathology does not necessarily invalidate everything downstream — but it demands that every claim be re-examined with the pathological mechanism as a competing explanation. (See Source Credibility Assessment.)
8. **The Narrative Crystallization** (v5.1): An interpretation (S₂) or hypothesis (S₃) is repeated across multiple outputs, publications, or transmissions until it is treated as established fact (S₀) — not because new evidence has emerged, but because repetition has created familiarity. Particularly dangerous in multi-output analytical sessions and in media environments where the same interpretation circulates across sources that appear independent but share the same origin.

---

## AXIS 3: FIGURE-MOVEMENT SEPARATION (v5.1)

### Principle

A public, historical, or mythological figure and the movement(s) that develop around or after that figure are **distinct analytical objects** with separate source chains, separate functional verification, and separate corruption profiles. SVP must analyze them independently before any downstream module (VERT, LENS, OBSERVER, PPRO) can operate.

The figure is not the movement. The movement is not the figure. The contamination between the two — in both directions — is itself a primary object of SVP analysis.

### The Structural Problem| Direction | Contamination | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Movement → Figure** | The movement attributes to the figure things the figure never said, did, or intended. The figure is retroactively reshaped to serve the movement's needs. | The "Tesla" of free-energy movements bears little resemblance to the historical Tesla. The "Buddha" of popular Western Buddhism is a construction with no S₀ basis. The "Giordano Bruno" of esoteric movements is substantially different from the documented philosopher. |
| **Figure → Movement** | The figure's authority (real or constructed) is used to legitimize the movement's practices, claims, or power structures, whether or not the figure would have endorsed them. | The Catholic Church's claims to Petrine authority. The Gurdjieff Foundation's claim to transmit Gurdjieff's teaching. Political movements that invoke a founder's name to legitimize positions the founder never held. |
| **Mutual Feedback Loop** | The movement reshapes the figure, then uses the reshaped figure to legitimize itself, then reshapes further based on the legitimized version. | Hitler as historical figure vs "Hitler" as symbol in neo-Nazi movements — the symbol feeds back into the historiography, which feeds back into the symbol. The Beatles as musicians vs "The Beatles" as cultural movement — the cultural significance retroactively reinterprets the musical output, which further amplifies the cultural significance. |

### Required Analysis

When SVP encounters a figure with associated movement(s), the analyst must produce **separate source chains**:

**Chain A — The Figure Itself:**
- What did this person actually say, write, do? (S₀)
- What did direct witnesses report? (S₁, with bias flags)
- Where does the documentary chain break?
- What is attributed to the figure that cannot be traced to S₀ or verified S₁?

**Chain B — The Movement(s):**
- When did the movement begin relative to the figure? (during figure's life, immediately after, generations later)
- Who founded or organized the movement? (may not be the figure itself)
- What does the movement claim the figure said/did/intended? At what source level?
- Where does the movement's narrative diverge from Chain A?

**Chain C — The Mythologized Figure:**
- What composite image has been constructed from Chains A and B?
- Which elements come from the figure (Chain A) and which from the movement (Chain B)?
- Has the mythologized version replaced the historical one in public discourse?
- Can the historical figure still be accessed through the mythological overlay?

### Diagnostic Questions

| Question | What It Reveals |
|---|---|
| "Would the historical figure recognize the movement that bears their name?" | Degree of divergence between Chain A and Chain B |
| "Does the movement need the figure to be mythological rather than historical?" | Whether mythologization serves the movement's power structure |
| "If we removed everything the movement attributes and kept only S₀, what remains?" | The actual signal underneath the noise |
| "Did the figure actively create the movement, or did the movement form around/after the figure?" | Attribution of agency — crucial for LENS and PPRO |
| "Are there multiple competing movements claiming the same figure?" | Indicates the figure has become a symbolic resource rather than a historical person |

### Application Examples| Figure | Movement(s) | Key Separation Issue |
|---|---|---|
| **Buddha** (S∅) | Theravada, Mahayana, Vajrayana, Zen, Western Buddhism | No S₀ exists. Each movement has constructed its own "Buddha." The movements are analyzable; the historical figure is not. |
| **Gurdjieff** (S₀) | Gurdjieff Foundation, various "Fourth Way" schools | S₀ abundant (his own books). The Foundation claims to transmit his teaching but the transmission chain (S₁→S₂) introduces interpretive layers. His own texts sometimes contradict what the Foundation teaches. |
| **Tesla** (S₀) | Free-energy movement, "suppressed genius" narrative | S₀ abundant (patents, papers, documented work). The movement has constructed a mythological Tesla (suppressed by Edison/JP Morgan, possessed of secret technologies) that diverges significantly from the documented inventor. |
| **Hamer** (S₀) | Germanic New Medicine movement(s) | S₀ exists (his publications). The movement has expanded his claims beyond what he documented, and multiple competing factions claim to represent his "true" teaching. Functional verification (Axis 2) is critical here. |
| **Hitler** (S₀) | Neo-Nazi movements, historical revisionism | S₀ abundant (Mein Kampf, speeches, documented orders). The mythologized figure — both demonized and deified depending on the movement — has in many contexts replaced the historical one. Separate analysis of the man, the regime, and the subsequent movements is required. |
| **Beatles members** (S₀) | Cultural movements (counterculture, spiritual seeking post-Maharishi, musical influence schools) | S₀ abundant (recordings, interviews, documented actions). The cultural movement that formed around them retroactively reinterprets their output through a mythological lens. The individuals' actual trajectories (including divergent post-breakup paths) are distinct from the collective mythology. |
| **Patanjali** (S∅/S₀ text only) | Modern yoga movement | The person may be mythological; the Yoga Sutra text exists (S₀ for the text, S∅ for the author). Modern yoga has stripped the text's prerequisites (yama/niyama) and transmitted only the techniques — a textbook case of Prerequisite Corruption (#6). |

### Output Integration

When the Figure-Movement Separation is relevant, the SVP output format adds:

```markdown
[AXIS 3: FIGURE-MOVEMENT SEPARATION]
- Chain A (Figure): [S₀ material, provenance gap, what the figure actually said/did]
- Chain B (Movement): [when formed, by whom, what it claims about the figure, divergences from Chain A]
- Chain C (Mythologized Figure): [composite image, which elements from A vs B, has myth replaced history?]
- Contamination Direction: [Movement→Figure / Figure→Movement / Mutual Feedback Loop]
- Competing Movements: [if multiple, list with key divergences]
- Diagnostic: [Would the historical figure recognize the movement?]
```

## INTEGRATION WITH OTHER MODULES

SVP is a **prerequisite module** for all structural analysis. Before any module evaluates a subject, SVP must first determine:

1. **What material is actually from the source** (S₀ vs S₁ vs S₂ vs S∅) — Axis 1.
2. **Whether the technology was ever functionally tested** (F1–F4) — Axis 2.
3. **Whether figure and movement(s) are properly separated** — Axis 3.
4. **What the overall source quality is** (see Overall Source Quality below).

The downstream modules then operate on the **verified dataset** that SVP produces, rather than on the unfiltered traditional/media narrative.

```
ANALYSIS SEQUENCE:
SVP (What do we actually know? Who said it? Did it work?)
  ↓
VERT (What is the tradition's structural diagnosis?)
  and/or
LENS (What is the human figure's structural anatomy?)
  and/or
OBSERVER (What is the system's trajectory and attractor?)
  ↓
PPRO (What are the power/manipulation dynamics?)
  ↓
SCIMS (What is the systemic impact on Jackpot thresholds?)
```

---

## REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT

Each analysis must include an SVP section (before or at the beginning of downstream analysis) structured as follows:

```markdown
[SVP — SOURCE VERIFICATION]

[AXIS 1: SOURCE CHAIN]
- S₀ Material: [list of direct source documents/artifacts]
- S₁ Material: [list of firsthand witness accounts, with witness identified and bias-flagged]
  - Compromised (S₁ᶜ): [if any — specify pathology-claim connection]
  - Hostile (S₁ʰ): [if any — specify hostility mechanism]
  - Loyal (S₁ˡ): [if any — specify loyalty mechanism]
  - Agenda-driven (S₁ᵃ): [if any — specify agenda]
- S₂+ Material: [list of interpretive/derivative sources used]
- S∅ Gaps: [claims with no verifiable source chain]
- Provenance Gap: [Closed / Narrow / Wide / Broken]

[OVERALL SOURCE QUALITY]
Rating: [HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW / CRITICAL]
- HIGH: Abundant S₀, closed gap, multiple independent S₁ for triangulation
- MEDIUM: S₁ dominant, narrow gap, triangulation possible but limited
- LOW: S₂+ dominant, wide gap, triangulation difficult
- CRITICAL: S∅ dominant, broken gap, structural analysis operates on tradition not testimony
Note: [any specific quality concerns]

[AXIS 2: FUNCTIONAL VERIFICATION]
- F1 Specification: [Is the technology specified enough to apply?]
- F2 Application: [Was it applied as prescribed? By whom?]
- F3 Prerequisites: [Were prerequisites defined (at S₀)? Met? Failure category if not met?]
- F4 Results: [Structural Change / Subjective / Psychotropic Exchange / Mobilization Exchange / Unfalsifiable / False Claim / None / Negative]
- Structural Fairness: [Were failures attributable to the technology or to misapplication?]
- Functional Verdict: [FUNCTIONAL / HAZARDOUS / UNVERIFIED / PSYCHOTROPIC / MOBILIZING / UNFALSIFIABLE / COUNTERFEIT / INERT / TOXIC / UNTESTED]

[AXIS 3: FIGURE-MOVEMENT SEPARATION] (include when figure has associated movements)
- Chain A (Figure): [S₀ material, provenance gap, what the figure actually said/did]
- Chain B (Movement): [when formed, by whom, what it claims, divergences from Chain A]
- Chain C (Mythologized Figure): [composite image, elements from A vs B, has myth replaced history?]
- Contamination Direction: [Movement→Figure / Figure→Movement / Mutual Feedback Loop]
- Competing Movements: [if multiple, list with key divergences]
- Diagnostic: [Would the historical figure recognize the movement?]

[CORRUPTION FLAGS]
- [List any corruption signatures detected, numbered 1-8 per the Corruption Signatures section]

[CONFIDENCE NOTE]
Analytical conclusions derived from this source base carry a maximum confidence of: [S₀/S₁/S₂/S₃]
Reason: [brief explanation of what limits confidence]

## VERSION NOTES — v5.1 (March 2026)

### Changes from v5.0| Change | Reason | Section |
|---|---|---|
| Symmetric source credibility assessment (S₁ʰ, S₁ˡ, S₁ᵃ flags) | Validation finding: original SVP flagged hostile sources but not loyal/agenda-driven ones | Axis 1, Source Credibility |
| Universal applicability declaration | SVP applies to any figure or system — public, historical, or mythological — without domain enumeration | PURPOSE |
| Figure-Movement Distinction | Separate analysis of figure and associated movement(s), with mythologization assessment and contamination direction | New section |
| Political/contemporary figure examples added | Demonstrate applicability beyond spiritual traditions | Axis 1, Application Examples |
| Relationship between source levels and analytical confidence | Prevent confusion between SVP source classification and Bootloader confidence grades | New section |
| Mobilization Exchange failure category | Equivalent of Psychotropic Exchange in political/social domain — energy exchanged for structural change | Axis 2, F3c and F4 |
| MOBILIZING functional verdict | Corresponds to Mobilization Exchange | Functional Verdict table |
| Narrative Crystallization corruption signature (#8) | Identified in validation session: hypotheses becoming premises through repetition | Corruption Signatures |
| Overall Source Quality rating in output format | Gives analyst quick reference before proceeding to downstream modules | Output Format |
| Confidence Note in output format | Links SVP source quality to downstream analytical confidence limits | Output Format |
| Extended integration map | Includes OBSERVER and SCIMS in analysis sequence | Integration section |
| Axis 3: Figure-Movement Separation | Figures and their movements are distinct analytical objects with separate source chains; includes contamination direction analysis and mythologization tracking | New Axis 3 section |

### Validated Through

- Application by experimental TE module to political figure analysis (Trump, 9 outputs — SVP section rated highest quality)
- Cross-validation against Bootloader v6.0 Confidence Preservation Protocol
- Hypervisor review of source chain methodology in political domain
